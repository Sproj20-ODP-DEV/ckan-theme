        Open Data Pakistan is brought to you by the National Center for Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC), Lahore
        University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and Higher Education Commission (HEC). It is a collaborative effort to
        help provide open data to all kinds of users, such as researchers, policymakers, communities, and businesses

        data to bring about social, economic and environmental benefits.

        Open Data Pakistan is one standardized platform that aims to create a culture of sharing data in Pakistan within
        every sector, public and private. A major goal is to have all datasets of Pakistan on this portal; therefore, it
        is crucial for different institutions to sign up and publish data and visualizations. This open data portal can
        be used as a tool to disseminate raw data and information. The portal also aims to help unlock the value of data
        by being able to analyze it in machine-readable and open formats.
